                Hey! I'm Abdul Rahman, I've been close to a computer since an early age, and been passionate about it ever since.

                I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools back in 2010, and from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I do programming in various languages and technologies, and had the privilege to work in a Recruitment Company and a SaaS Company. I'm interested in building something awesome with code and automating tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development, Open Source, and Competitive Programming.

            <p className='about-paragraph'>
                When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
